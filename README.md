# DataReconcile AI

**Status: synthetic MVP deployed to Railway staging, with scoped CI evidence. Not production-ready; G1-E and authenticated customer acceptance remain open.**

Deterministic transaction reconciliation, exceptions, approvals and auditability.

The first executable slice imports synthetic rows, uses integer minor units, performs deterministic same-currency 1:1 matching, creates exceptions, records authorized resolutions, and finalizes an immutable report. It never transfers funds or uses floating-point amounts.

## MVP run and test

```bash
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-runtime.lock
python -m pip install -e 'apps/api[test]' -r scripts/requirements-verification.txt
export APP_ENV=development AUTH_MODE=development
export AUTH_ISSUER=https://issuer.synthetic.invalid AUTH_AUDIENCE=forgeworks-api
export DEV_AUTH_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))')"
export ARTIFACT_SIGNING_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))')"
python scripts/development_token.py
RECONCILE_SEED_FIXTURE=1 PYTHONPATH=apps/api/src uvicorn datareconcile_ai.main:app --reload
```

The printed token lasts 15 minutes and belongs to the local synthetic tenant/user. Use a second terminal with the same explicit development environment to run python -W error -m pytest tests. Never enable fixtures or reuse the development token on hosted infrastructure or customer data.


## Documents
- Product scope: `docs/product/PRODUCT_SCOPE.md`
- Architecture and file ownership: `docs/architecture/`
- Source contracts: `contracts/openapi.yaml` and `contracts/events.schema.json`
- Candidate SQL: `docs/verification/sql-candidates/` (NOT migration scripts)
- Signoff / blockers: `docs/verification/DESIGN_GATE_STATUS.md` and `docs/governance/MASTER_G1_DECISION.md`

## Local verification
Install dependencies from `scripts/requirements-verification.txt` then run:

```bash
python scripts/verify_bootstrap.py
python scripts/verify_contracts.py
python scripts/validate_openapi_independent.py
```

CI runs on main and verifies the complete test tree, OpenAPI/event contracts, generated TypeScript client, implemented PostgreSQL MVP runtime, tenant RLS/concurrency and disposable logical backup/restore. These are scoped synthetic proofs; full G1-E and production operations remain open.

## Non-goals at this stage
No production deployment, customer data, code-execution agent, customer production access, financial mutation, license assertion or fake passing tests.

## Governance
The owner approved proceeding with GitHub bootstrap. Technical G1-E controls are still pending until their tests actually pass and evidence is reviewed. See `docs/governance/MASTER_G1_DECISION.md` for pre-approval baseline language; the owner approval is recorded here as a later decision.


## Engineering continuation

See [current changes and residual gaps](docs/evidence/ENGINEERING_CONTINUATION.md). Configure authentication explicitly; development fixture commands now require `AUTH_MODE=development`, `APP_ENV=development`, a locally generated `DEV_AUTH_SECRET` of at least 32 bytes, and issuer/audience configuration. Never reuse test fixture credentials outside tests.

## Current main engineering status

Development/disposable source ingestion now supports `/v1/artifacts/upload-intents`, signed bounded byte transfers, `/commit`, verified downloads, and import from a committed CSV artifact. Apply migration `003_source_artifact_ingestion.sql` using the separate migration role. Set a separate `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_SECRET`; never use the authentication signing secret. CSV bytes are limited to 1 MiB and validated before availability. The database-backed transfer adapter fails closed outside development/test; external storage, malware scanning and retention/deletion are still required.

Also apply `004_artifact_immutability.sql`: PostgreSQL rejects changes to declared metadata, uploaded bytes/generation, or backward state transitions even when issued by the tenant application role. SQLite remains a disposable development adapter and does not claim this database-enforced guarantee.

See [current G1/G2 evidence](docs/verification/CURRENT_GATE_EVIDENCE.md), [exact source receipt](docs/evidence/MAIN_VERIFICATION_2026-10-09.json), and [owner main authorization](docs/governance/ENGINEERING_MAIN_AUTHORIZATION_2026-10-09.md). PostgreSQL adapters exist for all five independent projects. Historical evidence retains its source SHA and narrower scope.

## Hosted release verification

See [runtime identity, private telemetry and production acceptance](ops/runbooks/RUNTIME_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md). Hosted releases expose a bounded source fingerprint and require a separate server-only metrics credential. Production startup requires separate infrastructure and an actual trusted, signed acceptance receipt. An unsigned template or passing synthetic CI does not establish production acceptance.


## Current owner specification and unified application

- **Owner design revision (2026-10-13):** [product specification](docs/specifications/PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION_2026-10-13.md). This is a **design target**, not proof every feature exists.
- **Five ForgeWorks products, one future application/domain:** [architecture](docs/platform/ONE_APP_FIVE_SERVICES.md). SealAngel Work is a separate planned repository/application/domain; neither domain name is configured by this documentation.
- **Actual implemented and verified behavior:** keep using [current scoped evidence](docs/verification/CURRENT_GATE_EVIDENCE.md) and the [hosted runbook](ops/runbooks/RUNTIME_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md). Local tests, staging claims and production acceptance are different gates.
- The 2026-10-09 G2 bootstrap record remains historical and must not be mistaken for today's repository status.

## Complete owner document package

[Full specifications and IR catalogue](docs/specifications/source/README.md) from the owner upload are included in this repository. Use the source files for full design detail and the adjacent product specification for the engineering summary. File hashes are recorded in the source index.
