# DataReconcile AI — Canonical repository file ownership (P0)

**Root:** `forgeworks-datareconcile-ai/` (design target; repository not created). This file describes **planned files**, not existing application code. `migrations/versions/` is only migration source; only `contracts/openapi.yaml` is machine-API definition; the other contract is the domain-event schema.

## Dependency rules (enforced at G2)
1. Domain imports Python standard library and pure domain types only. Domain must not import FastAPI, DB, browser, cloud SDK, or LLM provider.
2. Application knows pure domain and abstract ports; infrastructure implements ports, with dependency inversion configured at composition root.
3. Presentation only validates transport/auth context and invokes application use cases. Client-supplied `tenant_id` is **never** authoritative.
4. Worker obtains scoped command context, commits effects through ledger, and cannot issue external writes unless approval revision/permission valid.
5. Web uses same-origin BFF session, not directly stored long-lived access tokens; integration credentials live encrypted server side.
6. Paths contain no production keys, generated client output committed only when its contract diff and licenses are reviewed.

## Software delivery skeleton
- `pyproject.toml` and `package.json` owner manifests plus lock files; environment/commit SHA must be captured in evidence.
- `.env.example` contains fake variables only, secret manager is authoritative for live environments.
- Branch checks: import boundaries, formatting/lint, unit, DB migration, contract test, static type check, security tests, isolated eval, SBOM/license scan, signed artifacts.
- Every repository gets its own deployment state and a separate encrypted database/tenant namespace; sharing a library is permitted only as a versioned package without runtime cross-product coupling.
