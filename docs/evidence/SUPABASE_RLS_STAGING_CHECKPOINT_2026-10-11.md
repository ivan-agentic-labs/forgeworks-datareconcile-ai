# Supabase RLS and Railway staging checkpoint, 2026-10-11

## Source and evidence scope

- Product repository: `ivan-agentic-labs/forgeworks-datareconcile-ai`.
- Verified application/schema source commit: `c71e60793b770660ee97fce5cecc12756da2cafb`.
- Railway staging **application** remains pinned to earlier verified commit `075e79a9c4fc26f4af16b2fcab47aac09c49e8e9`. Database policy migrations were applied separately. These are different version dimensions and should not be confused.
- Source of truth for applied SQL: `infra/environments/staging/` (004_tenant_rls_initplan.sql, 005_remaining_tenant_rls_initplans.sql).
- Supabase project `fljekuwplgkrpdoajyhn`, schema specific to this product. Railway project `1b35f35d-ad5b-4b93-ad20-ed68251b4589`, staging environment `0395e7ac-10f8-4004-8bb7-ddee901343c7`.
- Entire five-product catalog at checkpoint: **62 / 62** application tables have RLS and FORCE RLS enabled.
- Supabase advisor across five products: `auth_rls_initplan` **58 -> 0**; `multiple_permissive_policies` **14 -> 2**; `unindexed_foreign_keys` **24 -> 19**. These are advisor counts, **not** proof of latency, customer security or operational readiness.

## Railway and database verification

- All five staging services returned Railway `SUCCESS`, one running replica each, zero crashed, zero pending rollout operations at checkpoint.
- RLS policies retain the original tenant equality in `USING` and `WITH CHECK`; direct `(SELECT current_setting(...))` initPlans remove the advisor warnings.
- No new anonymous or authenticated role grants were created by these policy migrations.
- Disposable PostgreSQL negative tenant tests passed in CI. A **live** role-switched RLS transaction using the available Supabase connector returned permission denied to `SET ROLE`; **do not mark that test passed**.
- Direct `/readyz` from this assistant's container failed due DNS resolution, but a separate GitHub-hosted runner has now independently verified public `/healthz` and `/readyz`, rejected a credential-free `/v1/jobs/` request with HTTP 401, and validated the frontend's safe Supabase Auth configuration. **Authenticated owner workflows are still untested.**

## Open release blockers

1. Supabase had two Auth identities with product grant metadata, but **zero ACTIVE product memberships** in all five product schemas at last verification. This requires independently validated user/tenant/role provisioning, then real authenticated positive and negative product-flow tests.
2. Leaked-password protection remains disabled per Supabase security advisor. Configure through the supported Auth administrative settings, then verify.
3. The two remaining multiple-permissive-policy warnings involve APIShield's webhook-specific policy behavior. **Do not remove** these authorization policies simply to zero a lint number.
4. Nineteen missing FK-covering indexes, six unused-index notices, and seven RLS-enabled no-policy INFO notices require workload-based review and intentional deny-by-default validation. Do not blindly add policies or remove indexes.
5. Production environment, customer consent/retention, isolated external integration tests, recovery drill, SLO/load evidence, cost monitoring, security and domain reviewer acceptance for G3-G6 are all **OPEN**.

## Acceptance

This checkpoint is evidence of **staging deployment + synthetic CI + current catalog lint state**, not authorization to use real customer data or launch production. Release process: `ops/runbooks/STAGING_RELEASE_AND_ROLLBACK.md`.

## Independent public HTTPS smoke evidence

- [GitHub Actions staging liveness, readiness, anonymous 401, and Auth-client-config proof](https://github.com/ivan-agentic-labs/forgeworks-datareconcile-ai/actions/runs/38090118748): `success`.
- This probe does **not** log publishable keys, does not hold tokens, uses no customer data, and does not prove a successful authenticated login, session revocation or cross-tenant negative cases against staging.
- Railway remains commit-pinned; the GitHub workflow probes the currently running staging revision, not necessarily the latest documentation-only `main` revision.
