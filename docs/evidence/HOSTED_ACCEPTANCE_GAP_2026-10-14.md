# Hosted production acceptance gap — DataReconcile AI
 
Audit snapshot: 2026-10-14. Source: connected GitHub main, Railway ForgeWorks staging, Supabase ForgeWorks project, and read-only catalog/aggregate SQL. **Not a production acceptance receipt.** SealAngel and customer data are excluded.

## Distinct evidence layers

| Layer | Observation | What it does NOT establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source | GitHub main at audit: `3f014dd655b0d9dbee7c6c9658df76685cb4bc1f` | Main commit automatically deployed |
| CI | [Observed successful workflow](https://github.com/ivan-agentic-labs/forgeworks-datareconcile-ai/actions/runs/38539304390) | Real authenticated two-tenant business acceptance |
| Railway staging | Terminal SUCCESS deployment `6ca6c055-1fc8-4e93-8766-8ac3d749d430`; pinned source `70ee65026b244006c70197f580119c0421820a01` in Singapore | That every post-release main commit is deployed, or production readiness |
| Supabase | ForgeWorks project `fljekuwplgkrpdoajyhn` ACTIVE_HEALTHY; fw_datareconcile_ai tables audited with RLS + FORCE RLS | RLS enforcement under real authenticated tenant sessions |
| Product membership | 2 membership rows, **0 ACTIVE, 2 REVOKED** | Any currently authorized test principal |
| Business fixtures | `fw_datareconcile_ai.reports`: 0 rows / 0 represented tenant(s) | Independently signed ownership or two real principal read/write flows |
| Product G3 / production | **BLOCKED / NOT_ACCEPTED** | Production launch authorization |

The membership observation comes from a read-only grouped-status SQL query. Revocation history is not known: **do not reactivate existing accounts as a shortcut**, do not modify auth tables directly, and do not use customer identities. Create independently authorized, fresh staging-only test accounts through official provisioning if permitted.

## Last acceptance dependencies (not a GitHub CI pass)

1. Independently authorize two distinct consenting staging-only Supabase identities with active product membership, server-owned app_metadata grants, and fresh sessions. Verify both access and revocation without placing tokens in source or logs.
2. Create one tenant-owned business fixture for each identity through the product's normal authorized flow. Existing aggregate counts are insufficient. Test own-record HTTP 200 and both cross-tenant HTTP 403/404; add write isolation and session revocation tests separately.
3. Two authorized report-generating reconciliation flows from approved synthetic source bytes and finance-domain acceptance.
4. Capture actual request IDs, observed deployed SHA + runtime manifest, secret-redacted test receipts, scoped performance/SLO, controlled restore/DR, security and privacy review, and independent signoff. Keep staging and production separately provisioned.
5. Review current Supabase security advisor findings: leaked-password protection warning and seven RLS-without-policy informational findings fleet-wide. Distinguish intentional deny-all internal tables from unintended exposure.

## Small, no-credential GitHub tasks

- Keep this evidence separate from synthetic/disposable test results. Bind each future test report to the exact reviewed source and observed runtime SHA.
- Validate release-record fields and reject candidate-vs-observed SHA/fingerprint drift. Avoid duplicating the existing fleet verifier.
- Exercise fail-closed unit tests for G3 fixture prerequisites and invalid/expired-session scenarios; never call a mocked token a hosted PASS.
- Prepare opt-in hosted G3 runbook. No automatic identities, credentials, database writes or production promotion.

## Verification boundary

A public `/healthz`, `/readyz` or anonymous HTTP 401 proves availability/boundary only. Production acceptance requires authenticated real end-to-end product and tenant proof. Current acceptance template stays UNSIGNED and all controls OPEN. Do not mark green because documentation or CI is present.

## Owner-authorized staging provisioning update — 2026-10-14 (after audit snapshot)

This section is **newer than the read-only audit snapshot above** and must not overwrite its historical observations.

- Owner gave explicit permission to provision fresh staging-only test principals, tenant fixtures, and synthetic acceptance data for the five-product ForgeWorks fleet.
- Connected Supabase management SQL created two **new** `ACTIVE` tenants for this product in project `fljekuwplgkrpdoajyhn`, one `g3-owner-20261014-tenant-a` and one `g3-owner-20261014-tenant-b`; a second SELECT verified two rows per product, five per slot across the fleet (10 total).
- Separate membership JOIN verified **zero memberships** attached to the new tenants in each product. No old `REVOKED` records or user accounts were modified.
- `forgeworks-apishield-agent/scripts/g3_staging_grants.sql` constructs exactly two server-owned Auth `app_metadata` grant plans with five narrow read scopes, one per product. It is read-only and does not confer access.
- **Auth Admin createUser/updateUserById is not supported by the connected Supabase app.** Railway OAuth lists variables but does not expose a privileged Auth Admin key, and app services have publishable keys only. Therefore no new Auth users or active memberships were created.
- The owner-controlled Auth Admin step, active membership registration, ten real business fixtures, authenticated hosted G3 test, write-isolation and revocation tests all remain **BLOCKED / NOT_ACCEPTED**. See [the central operator runbook](https://github.com/ivan-agentic-labs/forgeworks-apishield-agent/blob/main/ops/runbooks/G3_OWNER_STAGING_PROVISIONING_2026-10-14.md).
