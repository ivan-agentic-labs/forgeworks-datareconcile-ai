# Current G1/G2 evidence — 2026-10-09

The owner authorizes engineering directly on main. Owner design approval is permission to proceed; it is not an independent domain/security/legal signoff or a G1-E test result. Five repositories remain independent/private. No production deployment or customer data is included.

| Area | Status | Evidence and limit |
|---|---|---|
| G2 repository bootstrap | VERIFIED | Independent repositories, blueprint documentation, contracts, engineering config, SDK and Actions; committed contents read back from GitHub. |
| Contract semantics/client | VERIFIED, scoped | Independent OpenAPI validator, event-schema checks, generated TypeScript compilation and selected runtime response validation. This does not prove all application response paths. |
| Implemented PostgreSQL MVP runtime | VERIFIED, disposable | Migrations 001/002, non-owner runtime role, forced tenant RLS, negative access and product-specific concurrent commands. Design-candidate schema/FK addendum is not applied or accepted by these tests. |
| Logical restore | VERIFIED, disposable | Fresh database dump/restore, table digests, columns, constraints, RLS flags and restored non-owner membership/context behavior. Not PITR, regional failover or production RTO/RPO. |
| JWT/OIDC | PARTIAL | Fixed algorithms, mandatory claims/UUID tenant, expiry/issuer/audience checks, offline key rotation and explicit configuration. Real IdP sessions, provisioning, BFF, CSRF and revocation remain open. |
| Storage/real source bytes | PARTIAL | APIShield local bytes and DataReconcile/AgentTest persisted report/export downloads have integrity evidence. External storage scanning, retention/deletion and source/dataset ingestion remain open. |
| Remote sandbox/provider/GitHub App | BLOCKED | Remote execution/effects fail closed. No independent escape/egress/SSRF proof, installed product GitHub App or real provider quality/cost proof. |
| Domain/privacy/operations/acceptance | OPEN | Human-adjudicated corpus/thresholds, legal/domain/accessibility review, independent signoff and production operating evidence are not supplied. |
| G1-E overall | OPEN/BLOCKED | Individual test success is not whole-gate acceptance. |

## Exact source receipt

Source: `206665d6d9937cd728f898411351938c074e8609`. This immutable receipt covers that exact source, including synthetic/disposable limits. Later engineering commits require their own CI results; current main workflow status is authoritative for those commits.

## Current product scope

Disposable logical restore verification now compares actual tenant RLS policy expressions/role bindings, table grants, and non-internal trigger definitions/functions, in addition to row digests, columns, constraints and RLS flags. This remains a logical disposable proof, not PITR, regional failover or production operating acceptance.

Migration 004 enforces artifact metadata and uploaded byte/generation immutability inside PostgreSQL, with guarded state transitions. Runtime startup requires the enabled trigger. Disposable proof attempts mutations using the application role and expects database rejection. SQLite integrity checks are application-level only; external retention/deletion and production storage remain open.

Non-demo runtime rejects metadata-only imports with SOURCE_BYTES_REQUIRED. Synthetic fixture rows require explicit seed provisioning in development/test and cannot be used in PostgreSQL runtime. Bounded database-backed source upload, immutable generation/digest/size verification, quarantine, strict UTF-8 CSV validation, commit, download and import from actual uploaded bytes are implemented for development/disposable proofs. Upload/commit/download commands detect idempotency conflicts; transfer capabilities are tenant/action/generation bound and re-check membership. Migration 003 forces tenant RLS on source artifacts and command ledgers. This is not external object storage, malware scanning or retention/deletion proof: production transfers return EXTERNAL_STORAGE_REQUIRED.

Strict synthetic CSV import, exact integer-minor-unit reconciliation, exception review, persisted report bytes and bounded report download. No payment or ledger transfer is performed.

## Remaining dependency and implementation register

### Import budget continuation, 2026-10-09

CSV parsing enforces 1 MiB of actual UTF-8 bytes, at most 10000 data rows, and external references up to 256 characters before import writes. Boundary tests cover exactly 10000 rows, overflow and multibyte content. This aligns inline imports with the bounded local artifact path, but does not implement external production storage or production throughput acceptance.

Aggregate monetary totals now accumulate exact Python integers from persisted minor units instead of SQLite SUM, which can overflow even when each source row is valid int64. Tests cover totals greater than signed 64-bit range. Backend JSON integers preserve exact values; JavaScript consumers still need an explicit large-integer transport/decoding strategy before claiming end-to-end precision for such totals.

Matching indexes right-hand candidates by currency, exact minor amount and transaction type, consuming queues in original row order. This preserves the existing amount-based rule and one-use allocation behavior while removing the repeated quadratic scan. It is not a semantic external-reference matching rule or measured production throughput claim.

1. Configure a real IdP and provisioned internal identities; finish BFF/session/CSRF/revocation and test them. This includes unfinished code, not only credentials.
2. Configure external private storage/scanning/retention/deletion and implement remaining source/dataset/upload adapters; do not treat placeholder metadata or quarantined objects as verified bytes.
3. Supply an isolated runner/network policy and product GitHub App configuration; implement and prove sandbox, webhook/revocation and approval-bound remote effects before enabling them.
4. Supply approved evaluation corpora/thresholds and provider budget; implement real source/scanner/agent paths and establish observed quality/cost/load/recovery results.
5. Obtain domain/legal/privacy/operations/independent acceptance. Production remains outside this authorized execution scope.

No background completion, production readiness or full-G1-E PASS is asserted.

## Latest local continuation — frontend precision and DOM safety
The static console now formats monetary and count values from decimal strings through `BigInt`, accumulates row totals without JavaScript `Number` coercion, and renders batch/exception/report values using DOM node `textContent` rather than raw `innerHTML` interpolation. Regression tests cover the large-integer path and assert that the console contains no `innerHTML` writes. This closes a concrete consumer-side precision/XSS gap in the synthetic UI only; it does not establish browser, CSP, BFF/session, external storage, or production acceptance evidence.
